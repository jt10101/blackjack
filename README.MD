## Background and Context : Why Blackjack?

Blackjack (or "Ban Luck" as we would call it here in Singapore), is a game that remind me of my childhood. Growing up in a large family, I was used to spending my weekends at my grandparents' place with my many cousins. As we all grew up and got on with our own lives, we all started drifting apart. Chinese New Year is the singular occasion where we get to gather like old times. At this gathering, we would always play Blackjack as a means to pass time. Playing the game reminds of simpler times back during my childhood where we get to laugh amongst each other.
